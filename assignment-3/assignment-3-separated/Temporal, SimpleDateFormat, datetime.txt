By default, the java.util.Date/java.util.Calendar objects are not
in a compatible format for usage in SQL. By using @Temporal, the 
java objects are converted to a type that is compatible with SQL date formats.

The usage of SimpleDateFormat allows us to convert back and forth 
from Java String to Java Date/Calendar.

From my understanding, the usage of @Temporal to convert Date/Calendar objects
is slightly depracted and usage of java.sql.Time, java.sql.Timestamp, and
java.sql.Date are now preferred.
